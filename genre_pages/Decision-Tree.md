# Decision Tree


## Quickstart

1. Is the web page [**Machine translated or generated**](MT) from a template?
2. Is the web page [**Lyrical**](LY), such as songs or poems? 
3. Is the web page originally spoken? (Texts composed of more than 50% spoken quotes classified as spoken)
    * If yes, is it an [**Interview**](SP-it)? 
    * If no, select [**Other spoken**](SP-os) (e.g. formal speeches and TV/movie transcripts)
4. Is the web page [**Interactive discussion**](ID) written by multiple participants in a discussion format (e.g. discussion or Q&A forum)? (Reader comments following e.g. an article or blog post are NOT included here) 
5. Is the purpose of the document to narrate or report on EVENTS?
   If yes, select one of the following registers:
    * [**News report**](NA-ne) 
    * [**Sports report**](NA-sr) 
    * [**Narrative blog**](NA-nb) (e.g a travel blog or a personal blog) 
    * [**Other narrative**](NA-on) (e.g. fictional stories and magazine articles)
6. Is the purpose of the document to explain HOW-TO or INSTRUCTIONS? 
    * If yes, is it a [**Recipe**](HI-re)? 
    * If no, select [**Other how-to**](HI-oh). These are typically step-by-step, objective instructions on how to do something.
7. Is the purpose of the document to describe or explain INFORMATION?
   If yes, select one of the following registers: 
    * [**Encyclopedia article**](IN-en) 
    * [**Research article**](IN-ra) 
    * [**Description of a thing or person**](IN-dtp) 
    * [**FAQ**](IN-fi) 
    * [**Legal terms and conditions**](IN-lt) (including long cookie texts) 
    * [**Other Informational description**](IN-oi) (e.g. course materials and blogs for informing the reader)
8. Is the purpose of the document to express OPINIONS? 
   If yes, select one of the following registers:
    * [**Review**](OP-rv)
    * [**Opinion blog**](OP-ob) (typically written by an amateur writer, such as a politician, to express their opinion)
    * [**Denominational religious blog / sermon**](OP-rs) 
    * [**Advice**](OP-av) (based on opinion; contrast with how-to text, which expresses objective instructions)
    * [**Other opinion**](OP-oo) 
9. Is the purpose of the document to describe or explain FACTS WITH INTENT TO PERSUADE or MARKET?
   If yes, select one of the following registers:
    * Is the text a [**Description with intent to sell**](IP-ds) a product or service? 
    * Is the text a [**News & opinion blog or editorial**](IP-ed)? These are typically written by a professional writer on a news-related topic, with well-structured argumentation.
    * If not, select [**Other informational persuasion**](IP-oe). These are descriptive texts that also sell or promote a service, product or upcoming event, such as a hotel, a smartphone or a football game.
